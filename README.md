# GDG_DevFest_Hackathon
[WIP]

Android app to gamify shared group tasks between roommates. Uses Firebase backend.

Rules :
1. Each member in a group start with equal points. 

2. Each group agrees on a set of common tasks to the group and associates points to the task. 

3. Tasks can be of two types - periodic task(which can earn a penalty if not completed on time) or bounty task( which can be claimed by group members to earn more points) 

4. A group member can trade her/his periodic task with points earned by her/him, and set it as a bounty task to the group.Any other member claiming this bounty task will have points of the task transfered to their total points.
